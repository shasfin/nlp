    Challenges are:
    - Ambiguity (at all levels)
	- Sparsity
	- World knowledge
	Levels:
	- Words (tokenization, in English there are whitespaces, in Chinese it's even more difficult)
	- Syntax
	- Semantics
	- Discourse

    An entity is one "thing" uniquely identifiable in a knowledge base
	Challenges:
	- Ambiguity (same word means different things)
	- Variability (different words mean the same thing)
	Named Entity Recognition (recognize and tag named entities such as 'Bank of America' - organization)
	Word Sense Disambiguation (which meaning of the word is used in a particular sentence)
		most used corpus: WordNet
	Approaches:
	- Wikipedia-based entity linking (that with Lara Croft)
	- TagME
	- Optimization (with integer linear programming)
	- Structured learning (joint mention detection, svm)
	- Graph based (solution belongs to dense subgraph or has higher page rank)
	- Topic modeling
	- Piggyback
	- LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation, represent a document as a mixture of a small number of topics and each word is attributable to one of the document's topics)
		The topics distribution is assumed to have a Dirichlet prior
	Similarity functions:
	- Link based (Google similarity)
	- Count based (pmi(x,y) = log(p(x,y) / p(x)p(y)))
	Eval metrics:
	- Precision = tp / (tp+fp)  | in the book: (#correct chunks given by the system) / (#chunks given by the system)
	- Recall = tp / (tp + fn)   | in the book: (#correct chunks given by the system) / (#actual chunks in the text)
	- F1 = 2*Precision*Recall / (Precision + Recall) = harmonic mean of precision and recall
